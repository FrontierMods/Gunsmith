# Gunsmith

*Gunsmith* (`gunsmith`) is a mod for *Cataclysm: Dark Days Ahead*.

It overhauls the gun modification system by providing a more in-depth view into the process. As a benefit, this overhaul also allows players to build their firearms from found parts.


# Gameplay & Design

## The Process of Assembly

Understanding the process of firearm assembly is essential for gunsmithing with this mod.

Refer to [`/documentation/ASSEMBLY_GUIDES/`](/documentation/ASSEMBLY_GUIDES/) for overview and detailed guides for each firearm platform.


## Sanity Checks

While this mod's main goal is to produce an accurate and meaningful firearm assembly / modification process, the mod remains limited by the game engine.

The measures taken to address or overcome said limitations are referred to as *sanity checks*. Refer to [`/documentation/SANITY_CHECKS.md`](/documentation/SANITY_CHECKS.md) for the complete up-to-date list. The author's hope is to be able to address these issues over time.
