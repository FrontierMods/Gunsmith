# Measurements


## Volume


### Barrel

`V = pi * (barrel radius ^ 2) * barrel length`

Some trim suggested: barrels never take exactly a cylinder's worth of space.

## Models

### AR-15

#### SOPMOD

The SOPMOD (Special Operations Peculiar MODification) kit is a set of accessories determined to be useful to Special Forces soldiers in the field. These are authorized for use with M4A1, CQBR, SCAR-L/-H, HK416, and other weapons used by Special Forces.

SOPMOD is a partially modular kit. In addition to a set of mandatory accessories, the soldier may pick a handful of enhancements, such as a red dot sight, a suppressor, a laser sight, or an underbarrel grenade launcher. Beyond that, improved parts could be used by soldiers in place of SOPMOD-mandated ones.

SOPMOD is historically divided into multiple blocks: sets of approved accessories. The full list of blocks, as well as further information on SOPMOD, can be found [on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOPMOD).

## Installation


### Stocks

Modern stocks for the AR-15 platform can be installed within a minute.


#### Mil-Spec vs. Commercial

There are two standards for buffer tube for the AR-15 platform: *mil-spec* and *commercial*.

Mil-spec is 1.15 inches in diameter, commercial is 1.17 inches.

The difference amounts to the fact that fitting an incompatible stock is either impossible or will result in loose configuration, which would result in worse recoil reduction and unnecessary noise of rattling.

Most commercial buffer tubes have a slanted back, which serves as their distinguishing feature.
