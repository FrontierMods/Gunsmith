# Measurements

## Volume

### Barrel

`volume = pi * (barrel radius ^ 2) * barrel length`

Some trim may be appropriate: barrels never take exactly a cylinder's worth of space, though many expand at the barrel nut (the end that attaches to the upper receiver).


# Firearms

## Models

### AR-15

#### SOPMOD

The SOPMOD (Special Operations Peculiar MODification) kit is a set of accessories determined to be useful to Special Forces soldiers in the field. These are authorized for use with M4A1, CQBR, SCAR-L/-H, HK416, and other weapons used by Special Forces.

SOPMOD is a partially modular kit. In addition to a set of mandatory accessories, the soldier may pick a handful of enhancements, such as a red dot sight, a suppressor, a laser sight, or an underbarrel grenade launcher. Beyond that, improved parts could be used by soldiers in place of SOPMOD-mandated ones.

SOPMOD is historically divided into multiple blocks: sets of approved accessories. The full list of blocks, as well as further information on SOPMOD, can be found [on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOPMOD).

## Data

### Suppressors

Firing a suppressed firearm cycles more gases back into the system.

When expecting to fire mostly suppressed, one ought to make a wider hole (gas port) in the barrel for the gas block, allowing the latter to take more gases in without eroding the gas port with pressure too much over time.


### Buffer Tubes

#### Mil-Spec vs. Commercial

There are two standards for buffer tube for the AR-15 platform: *mil-spec* and *commercial*.

Mil-spec is 1.146 inches in diameter, commercial is 1.17 inches.

The difference amounts to the fact that fitting an incompatible stock is either impossible or will result in loose configuration, which would result in worse recoil reduction and unnecessary noise of rattling.

Some commercial buffer tubes have a 5° slanted back, which serves as their distinguishing feature.

Mil-spec is the original military-grade specification. Commercial design has proven to be cheaper, in order to accomodate the civilian market. The increased diameter of the commercial specification allows threads to be cut in, as opposed to mil-spec's roll-in process.


#### Buffer Materials

Common buffer materials:

*average weight*

* aluminum
    - 0.22 oz. ≈ 6 g
* steel
    - 0.64 oz. ≈ 18 g
* tungsten
    - 1.5 oz. ≈ 46 g


#### Buffer Weight

Used to counteract recoil. The heavier the buffer, the more recoil is countered.

Some buffers are configurable / adjustable.

Common configurations:

*weight materials* / *typical weight*

* carbine
    - 3× steel
    - 3.0 oz. ≈ 85 g
* heavy / H / H1
    - 1× tungsten + 2× steel
    - 3.8 oz. ≈ 108 g
* HH / H2:
    - 2× tungsten + 1× steel
    - 4.6 ~ 4.7 oz. ≈ 130 ~ 133 g
* HHH / H3:
    - 3× tungsten
    - 5.4 ~ 5.6 oz. ≈ 153 ~ 159 g
* heavy stainless-steel tungsten / HSS
	- solid 303 stainless steel + 1× tungsten
    - 6.5oz. ≈ 184 g
* extra-heavy / XH
	- solid 303 stainless steel + 1× tungsten
    - 8.5oz. ≈ 241 g
* rifle
    - 5× steel + steel spacer
    - 5.0 ~ 5.3 oz. ≈ 142 ~ 150 g

##### Pistol-Caliber Builds

With pistol-caliber AR-15 builds, the gas system operates differently, preventing the gases from softening bolt action. Therefore, heavier buffers are typically used for smoother operation of the firearm.

Typical weight of a pistol-build buffer ranges from 5.0 to 8.5 oz ≈ 142 to 241 g.


#### Buffer Tube Length

Buffer tubes are nor interchangable by length, and must be used with the appropriate stocks.

Common buffer lengths:

* carbine
* rifle

Uncommon buffer lengths:

* pistol / "shorty"
* intermediate / A5

On the AR-15 platform, generally, carbine-length buffer tubes are used with collapsible stocks, and rifle-length – with fixed stocks.

Carbine-length AR-15 buffers are also referred to as M4, due to association with the M4A1. Rifle-length – A1/A2, due to association with M16A1/M16A2.


#### Buffer Springs

Buffer spring pushes the bolt back into position after cocking or firing. They are therefore responsible for the cycling of the bolt, along with the buffer itself. Too heavy a buffer hinders cycling and may prevent the cycle from completing. This results in inconsistent ejection of the fired round, which may result in a jam: the bolt cannot move forward and operate because it's stuck on the shell that's still in the ejection port.

Springs are usually made of steel alloy.

Springs shorten over time with use. Carbine-length springs are considered servicable if over 10 in. ≈ 254 mm. Rifles-length springs are considered servicable if over 12 in. ≈ 305 mm. Shorter springs then those are advised to be replaced.

Springs may run against the internal surface of the buffer tube during operation. Smoother surface or special finish helps lubrication of the spring, thus reducing operation noise. Silent captured systems eliminate the noise by restricting possible movement within the buffer tube, as well as sealing the tube's contents from dirt.

Longer springs provide more return power, thus reducing effective recoil.

Common spring configurations:

*average length* / *average coils*

* carbine
    - 10.0625 ~ 11.25 in. ≈ 256 ~ 286 mm
    - 37 ~ 39 coils
* rifle
    - 11.75 ~ 13.5 in. ≈ 299 ~ 343 mm
    - 41 ~ 43 coils
